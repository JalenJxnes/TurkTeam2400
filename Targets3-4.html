                 While it does seem to be that their are groups in place that are making attempts to cut these numbers down, it does not appear to have yielded any results yet. As many females are still being married off before they come of age they see a shift in their plans going from what could have been an independent lifestyle to being forced into life of a domestic partnership with ties of responsibility to another person and their family. Because of these ties it can prevent women from persuing further education and perhaps certain job roles/responsible positions. While it has caught more attention in the public eye as an issue, it may take some time to stop forced marriages all together. While their is a positive note that if the marriage seems unfitting for both parties and their is proof of the arrangement being forced the marriage can be granted an annulment by the judge. </p>

            <p class="fs-4">  Overview:<br>
                 The amount of time women spend in unpaid labor and domestic work is astonishing. Roughly 1/6<sup>th</sup> of their day is spent taking focusing on domestic chores. This is also has an impact on their social and mental health since these are needed tasks that require 100% of their effort and take top priority above other tasks, women do not have any time to focus on their wellbeing, and making an impact on their community let alone a presence to be felt. With such little time for other activities women feel the impact that this has on making any commitment to furthering education or possible lifestyles that may have wanted to pursue.</p>
